# Flatiron School Phase 1 Project - Brewery Directory

## Project Description

For my phase-1 project at Flatiron school I created a simple brewery directory. 
My app uses HTML/CSS/JS as a frontend and accesses data from a public API. The public API, https://api.openbrewerydb.org/breweries, is free and require no authorization. 

Once the app loads, it will display all distinct states from the API. When you click on a state, it will display a list of brewery names and addresses for that state. A simple directory. 

## Getting Started

2. On your local terminal do a ```git clone``` command
3. Enter ```explorer.exe index.html``` to open website
